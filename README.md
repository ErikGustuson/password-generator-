# Password Generator
​
Are you in need of new password.  If you are then you're in the right place. During this project this has been my first attempt and writing a JS script. As you will notice as you use this generator, it will give you a few options as to what type of characters you would like included or not included in your password. You can select between uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters. You are also give the option to select how many you would like included. You can select between 8 and 128 characters. This is the first time i have been able to try my hand at using functions, if statements and interations
